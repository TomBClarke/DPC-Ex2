Assignment fully completed and correct.

Special features:
 - We use a random number generator to pick points.
 - We have fairly high code reuse.
 - It parses the input backwards which is more efficient.
 - We sanity check the input and return nice error messages if it's incorrect.
 - We use Erlang 20.2 (Eshell 9.2)
